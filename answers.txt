What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?

.gitignore tells git which files (or patterns) it should ignore. It's usually used to avoid committing
transient files from your working directory that aren't useful to other collaborators, such as
compilation products, temporary files IDEs create, etc.
For a Java Project, the following filetypes should be included in .gitignore:
# Compiled class file
*.class

# Log file
*.log

# BlueJ files
*.ctxt

# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
.mtj.tmp/

# Package Files #
*.jar
*.war
*.nar
*.ear
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.rar

What does fast-forward in Git mean?

When you try to merge one commit with a commit that can be reached by following the first commit’s
history, Git simplifies things by moving the pointer forward because there is no divergent work to
merge together — this is called a “fast-forward.”

Why should you have different branches?

Using branches help you organize the workflow more efficiently and rather effortlessly. In every
project, there are always multiple different contexts where work happens. Each feature, bugfix,
experiment, or alternative of your product is actually a context of its own. A branch represents
exactly such a context in a project and helps you keep it separate from all other contexts.

In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?

We can have any number of remote repositories in a project. But we can only have one remote named
"origin".
